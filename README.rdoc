Gem for interacting with the Esendex API

This is in very early stages of development

== Sending Messages Now

First instantiate an Account with your credentials
	
	account = Account.new("EX123456", "user@company.com", "yourpassword")
	
then, call the send method on the account object with a message. The return value is a batch_id you can use to obtain the status of the messages you have sent.

	batch_id = account.send_message(Message.new("07777111222", "Saying hello to the world with the help of Esendex"))

Multiple messages are sent by passing an array of Messages to the send_messages method
	
	batch_id = account.send_messages([Message.new("07777111222", "Hello"), Message.new("07777111333", "Hi")])
	
== Errors



== Testing

	rake test

	rake integration_test
